Observed Behavior (OB): All sentences describing an incorrect or unexpected behavior of the app’s misbehavior.
Steps to Reproduce (S2Rs): All sentences that describe the actions made on the app to replicate or reproduce the incorrect or unexpected app behavior. 

Consider the following factors for identifying EB. 

Expected Behavior of the app (EB): 
        1        An EB sentence describes expected or correct app behavior. The EB is usually the opposite of the OB. 
        2        There could be multiple EB sentences anywhere in the bug report, including the first sentence of the bug report, marked with (0). 
        3        A sentence can describe more information besides the EB; in such cases, the whole sentence is an EB sentence.
        4        An EB sentence can be also an OB sentence if it describes both observed behavior and expected behavior. Typically these sentences contain phrases like “rather than”, “instead of”, etc.

Consider the following factors for identifying EB. 

Expected Behavior of the app (EB): 
        1        An EB sentence describes expected or correct app behavior. The EB is usually the opposite of the OB. 
        2        There could be multiple EB sentences anywhere in the bug report, including the first sentence of the bug report, marked with (0). 
        3        A sentence can describe more information besides the EB; in such cases, the whole sentence is an EB sentence.
        4        An EB sentence can be also an OB sentence if it describes both observed behavior and expected behavior. Typically these sentences contain phrases like “rather than”, “instead of”, etc.
